## Description

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc). 

## Data description

Data are available on the Kaggle platform: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

## Note

This project's purpose is to discover the Kaggle platform and apply basics Data Science principle.  
All the process is coded in Python, and result in a 78% accuracy model.  

I would gladly receive any contribution and recommendation to improve this work and therefore develop my skills.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy!
